# üö¶ Smart Traffic Control & Surveillance System

An <u>**AI**-powered</u> real-time multitasking system using advanced **machine learning** and **computer vision** to optimize urban traffic flow and enhance road safety. Using **Raspberry Pi** and camera modules for edge computing, it detects and classifies vehicles (**bike, car, bus, truck**), monitors **helmet usage**, **measures speed**, **number plates recognition** using (**OCR & Google Cloud Vision API**), and detect **emergency vehicles** like ambulances and fire brigades. The system dynamically adjusts traffic signals based on real-time traffic density and **prioritizes emergency vehicles** by instantly granting them green signals. All surveillance data including vehicle images, license plates, speed, location, and violations like red light jumping is securely uploaded to **cloud storage** and **web platform** using **RESTful APIs**. The platform provides **live analytics, vehicle info. search by license number, violation logs, Live map, and an automatic challan generation system**. Designed for government use, it ensures real-time updates, advanced 3 layer **authentication**, with security & privacy.

## üß† Problem Statement

‚ûî **Real world traffic problem:** Due to exponential growth of vehicles, traffic increasing day by day and  Conventional traffic signal systems rely on fixed timers or rudimentary sensors, leading to inefficiencies such as prolonged congestion, fuel waste, and increased emissions.

‚ûî **Raising Traffic Violations:** Helmet-less riding, signal jumping, and triple riding are rampant in many cities. Manual enforcement is ineffective and resource-intensive. Our system automatically detects violations using machine learning (YOLO model), improving enforcement efficiency.

‚ûî **Emergency Response Delays:** Congestion and poor traffic flow slow down emergency vehicles. By monitoring real-time traffic, the system can be scaled to prioritize emergency vehicle movement and dynamically manage signals.

‚ûî **Lack of Centralized Data:** Current systems don‚Äôt store violation data for easy access or reporting. Our solution uploads detected violations to the cloud, enabling officials to track offenders via license plate recognition and access reports through a web interface.

## ‚úÖ Approach & Solution

We propose an **intelligent traffic control and surveillance system** using:
- **Edge computing** on Raspberry Pi with live camera feeds  
- **Custom YOLO11 ML model** for vehicle detection and classification, **Helmet, Speed, ANPR, Red light violation, Emergency vehicle detection**  
- **Automatic signal control based on traffic density and prioritizes emergency vehicles**  
- **Cloud storage** of surveillance data (images, license plates, logs) 
- **Web-based dashboard** for real-time analytics, live map and enforcement  

All data is processed in real-time, securely stored on Google Cloud, and made accessible to authorities through an advanced, role-based authentication system.
